# 2. Basic Operators

## Assignment Operator

We have already used the assignment operator for simple values.

```Swift
var value = 17
value = 1337
```

### Exercise 2.1

What would happen if you used the assignment operator in the following way? (This is mainly an exercise for Objective-C coders.)

```Swift
let value = 17

if value = 19 {
    print("Whatever and stuff.")
}
```
