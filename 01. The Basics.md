# 1. The Basics

## Constants and Variables

### Exercise 1.1

Declare a floating point variable that represents temperature and assign the current
temperature to it. If you don't have a thermometer, guess the temperature. :-)

Then assign a different temperature to it. Pick one at random, it doesn't matter.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
```Swift
var currentTemperature = 18
print(currentTemperature)

currentTemperature = 12
print(currentTemperature)
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.2

Declare a constant integer value that represents the number of seconds in an hour
and assign that number to it on the same line.

Then try to assign a different value to the constant. Why doesn't it work?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
```Swift
let secondsInADay = 3600
print(secondsInADay)

// This does not work, because it is a constant and thus cannot be changed.
secondsInADay = 1337
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.3

Declare an integer variable with an explicit type annotation and then one without.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
```Swift
var someVariable: Int
var someOtherVariable = 1337
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.4

Declare a constant integer value that represents the number of wheels of a car.
*Don't* assign it a value on the same line.

On the next line, assign a value to the constant. Why does this work?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
It works, because the constant can be assigned to once, but it doesn't have to be on the same line.
```Swift
let numberOfWheels: Int
numberOfWheels = 4
print(numberOfWheels)
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.5

Declare the constant Ï€ using the name Ï€, which you can type by pressing `alt-p`.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
```Swift
let Ï€ = 3.141592654

print(Ï€)
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.6

Declare a variable using an emoji in the name.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
```Swift
let ðŸ’© = "turd"
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.7

Print a variable using the `print()` function.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
```Swift
var year = 2016
print(year)
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.8

What is the maximum value that can be stored in an Int16? Write the code that prints the maximum value of the Int16 type.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
```Swift
print(Int16.max)
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.9

What type is the constant pi in the example below? Why?

```Swift
let pi = 3 + 0.141592654
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
```Swift
let pi = 3 + 0.141592654

// Print the type of pi. The compiler inferred that it's a Double.
print(type(of: pi))
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.10

What happens if you try the following code? Why?

```Swift
let myNumber: UInt = -17
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
You get the following compiler error:
```
negative integer '-17' overflows when stored into unsigned type 'UInt'
```

UInt means Unsigned Integer, which means it cannot be negative.

```Swift
print(Int.min)
print(Int.max)

print(UInt.min)
print(UInt.max)
```
</details>


### Exercise 1.11

What happens if you try the following code? Why?

```Swift
let bigNumber: Int16 = 32767 + 1
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
The compiler reports an overflow error. The max value of Int16 is 32767.
</details>

### Exercise 1.12

Why does the following code not work? What do you need to add to it to make it work,
if we absolutely want to store this value as an integer, i.e. 3, but we don't want
to change the type of the variables?

```Swift
let pi = 3.141592654
let approximatePi: Int = pi
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
`pi` is a Double value. It must be explicitly converted to an Int.
```Swift
let pi = 3.141592654
let approximatePi: Int = Int(pi)

print(approximatePi)
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.13 EXTRA CREDIT

The following code will print `true`, which means that valueA and valueB are equal. Why are they equal?
(The `<<` is the bitshift left operator.)

```Swift
let valueA: Int16 = -0x8000
let valueB: Int16 = 0x4000 << 1

print(valueA == valueB)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Because integers are represented as two-complement values, 0x4000 << 1 for a 16 bit signed integer ends up being 0x8000 which is actually -32768. -0x8000 also ends up being represented as 0x8000 when the compiler stuffs the value into the 16 bit signed integer.

```Swift
print("0x4000 << 1 = \(0x4000 << 1)")

let valueA: Int16 = -0x8000
let valueB: Int16 = 0x4000 << 1

print("valueA = \(valueA)")
print("valueB = \(valueB)")

print(valueA == valueB)
```
